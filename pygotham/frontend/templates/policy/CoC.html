    <h1>Code of Conduct:</h1>
    <p>PyGotham is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone.
    We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Conference participants violating these 
    rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the 
    discretion of the conference organizers.</p>
    <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, 
    sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images 
    in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or 
    recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, 
    and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected 
    to comply immediately. </p>

    <p>Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject 
    to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, 
    activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized 
    clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>

    <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action 
    they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference 
    with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have 
    any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by t-shirts/special badges. </p>

    <p>PyGotham has an additional rule of no videotaping or photography without prior permission.
    If you wish to photograph, film or record any attendee, including speakers, you must first ask for 
    their permission to do so.</p>

    <p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local 
    law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe 
    for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance. </p>

    <p>[Phone number for conference security or organizers] </p>
